# README

This is the source code for [my personal static website](https://kaisoapbox.com). I'm using Astro, based on their blog template:

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template blog
```

My old site was built with Jekyll, and you can check out the source code [here](https://github.com/kaisoapbox/old_jekyll_site).
