# greetings, friend! ü•∞
kai here, thanks for visiting my website! here are a couple things you might be interested in:

- [Orbital Flush, a toilet that flushes in sync with the International Space Station and rotates to track it](/projects/orbital_flush)
- [Android apps for local privacy-first speech transcription](/projects/local_whisper)
- [a short silly story game](/projects/gone_to_the_store)

I am always working on several new projects, here are the current highlights:

- another story game titled "You're Not a Monk"
- a guide on how to cook without time, money, or skill, tentatively titled The Minimum Viable Kitchen [or perhaps The Bachelor(ette)'s Cooking Guide]
