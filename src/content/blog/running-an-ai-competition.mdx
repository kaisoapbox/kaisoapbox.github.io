In case you're not aware, the main thing that I have done for work over the last two years (2024 and 2025) has been to run an AI competition for a government agency, the Defence Science Technology Agency of Singapore (DSTA). This has been a lot of work, but also a lot of fun. This year, our scope expanded massively, and I got to hire two interns to assist me in this technical endeavour. 

Eventually, I will finish my own blogpost on this. For now, you can read what my extremely talented and profoundly hireable technical colleagues wrote:
1. [Ada Ho, who wrote an excellent technical breakdown of her work on the competition task design and the difficulties of managing AI infrastructure, among other things.](https://scallion3008.github.io/til-ai-2025/?utm_source=kaisoapbox.com)
2. [Qi Tianshi, who wrote a wonderful part-memoir part-technical postmortem that will be a far better read than whatever I will eventually produce.](https://qitianshi.medium.com/i-helped-build-singapores-biggest-ai-competition-d5a01e1a6aaa?utm_source=kaisoapbox.com)
