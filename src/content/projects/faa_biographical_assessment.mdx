### Acknowledgements

Thanks to [@TraceWoodgrains](https://x.com/tracewoodgrains) who both inspired this project with [this thread](https://x.com/tracewoodgrains/status/1752197404768571629), and enabled it by sharing the [public court filings he got from Brigida v. US DoT](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17Vi9dDtZvbwHDafrygRGYcG888f-6PDs), from which I meticulously copied all the assessment questions. You should read his commentary, available either [on Twitter (X)](https://x.com/tracewoodgrains/status/1752091831095939471) or [his Substack](https://www.tracingwoodgrains.com/p/the-faas-hiring-scandal-a-quick-overview?utm_source=kaisoapbox).

5 Feb 2025 update: Trace has released [a new piece about the FAA's hiring scandal](https://www.tracingwoodgrains.com/p/the-full-story-of-the-faas-hiring?utm_source=kaisoapbox), which is phenomenal and you should absolutely read it. You might be here from that piece, if so, hi! ðŸ‘‹
